Q. Find the room types that are searched by most people.
Output the room type alongside the number of searches for it.

If the filter for room types has more than one room type, consider each unique room type as a separate row.
Sort the result based on the number of searches in descending order.

Answer:

WITH cte AS
(SELECT distinct ds
,id_user
,ds_checkin
,ds_checkout
,value
,n_searches
FROM airbnb_searches cross apply string_split
(filter_room_types, ','
)
WHERE value <> ''
)
SELECT value
,SUM(n_searches) AS number_of_searches
FROM cte
GROUP BY value
ORDER BY number_of_searches desc


Q & A:

1. Where does value come from?  

The value is generated from the string_split function. The string_split function is a function in SQL Server that is used to split a string into multiple parts according to the specified delimiter. Each part is returned as a separate row.
In this code, the string_split function is used to split the filter_room_types field by commas. Each split part is returned as a separate row, and the value of this row is value. Therefore, value is each part of the filter_room_types field after being separated by commas.

2. What is the purpose of value?

The purpose of generating a value is to separate each room type in the filter_room_types field so that we can perform separate statistics and analysis on each room type. For example, we can count the number of searches for each room type, or find out the most popular room types.
If we don't generate a value, we can't perform separate statistics and analysis on each room type in the filter_room_types field because they are all in one field and cannot be separated.

3. What is the purpose of the WHERE clause in the CTE? 

The WHERE clause in the CTE is used to filter out any empty values that may have been generated by the string_split function. The condition value <> '' ensures that only non-empty values are included in the result set.

4. What is the purpose of the GROUP BY clause in the final SELECT statement?

In SQL, the GROUP BY clause is used to combine values ​​from multiple rows into one group so that aggregate functions such as SUM, COUNT, MAX, MIN, AVG, etc. can be applied to each group.
In the final SELECT statement, the purpose of the GROUP BY clause is to group the result set by the specified column (or combination of columns) so that we can apply aggregate functions to each group to get statistical information for each group.
For example, if we want to know the number of each room type, we can group by the room_type column and then use the COUNT function on each group. In this way, each row in the result set will contain a room type and the number of that type.

5. What is the purpose of the ORDER BY clause in the final SELECT statement?

In SQL, the ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set. You can sort by one or more columns, and the sorting can be ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC).
In the final SELECT statement, the purpose of the ORDER BY clause is to sort the result set by the specified column (or combination of columns). This makes it easier for you to view and understand the results, especially when the result set is large.
For example, if you want to see the most popular room types, you might sort by the count column in descending order so that the most popular room types appear at the top of the result set.

6. Isn't it redundant to include distinct ds ,id_user ,ds_checkin ,ds_checkout?

In this SQL code, distinct ds, id_user, ds_checkin, ds_checkout may indeed be redundant, depending on your data and the results you want.
The distinct keyword is used to return unique rows. Here, it returns all rows where the ds, id_user, ds_checkin, ds_checkout fields are unique. If you have repeated combinations of these fields in your data and you don't want to see these repeated rows in the results, then using distinct makes sense.
However, if you don't have repeated combinations of these fields in your data or you don't care about these repeated rows, then using distinct is redundant because it doesn't change the results, but it may increase the complexity and run time of the query.
In addition, if you only care about the value field and the n_searches field (i.e. you only care about the number of searches for each room type), then you may not need the ds, id_user, ds_checkin, ds_checkout fields, so using distinct ds, id_user, ds_checkin, ds_checkout is also redundant.
